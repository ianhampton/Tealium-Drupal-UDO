Drupal Basic Data Layer
==================

Extends the unofficial Tealium Drupal module (https://drupal.org/project/tealium), creates a basic data layer.

Automatically adds custom fields to the UDO along with some other basic data sources.

~~Alters the Tealium tag so that it's async and uses multi-CDN, moves the tag below the opening body tag.~~

(Now standard in v7.x-1.1 of the Tealium module)

Installation
------------

Copy to your modules directory and enable in the Drupal admin interface.
